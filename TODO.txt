Finishing training
- train final commentary

Optimization
- long optimization, tournament mode, 30s per move (needs distributed) - include cpuct
- final optimization with just move diversity parameters (consider adding visit%/upweight% threshold) - 30s per move

Deployment
- consolidate scripts, clean up root

Measurements
- Tournament Elo across training history (teacher/student, all SWA, every 400k)
- Deep tournaments, calculate ratings vs. various engines, CC with AZ-PUCT, etc., with various time controls - keep PGNs
- Controlled NPS (fixed movetime, multiple trials) (cache/no, teacher/student, TPU/GPU)
- Self-play games/hour steady-state (from 10 chunks to 20 chunks or w/e) (cache/no, teacher/student, TPU/GPU)
- Training time per checkpoint for main model and commentary (TPU/GPU)
- Test suite results (STS, Arasan21) (teacher/student, TPU/GPU)
