Next
- try map instead of unordered_map for small child counts
- try lerp stockfish eval during self-play
- try squeeze/excite
	- https://github.com/titu1994/keras-squeeze-excite-network
- try Wu improvements (accelerating go learning)
- experiment with endgame tablebases integrated

Performance
- break down MCTS timing details just in case anything's off (just use sampling)
- try 16-bit for self-play - need to look up weight compatibility
- load games faster - overlapped I/O?

Training quality
- try to get tensorboard integrated - can probably just log from py training code
- run tournaments against stockfish or something known/lower to estimate Elo
- Integrate Strategic Test Suite (STS) - wait for UCI first or no?

Code quality
- unify config across C++/Python
- privatize C++ methods (got too python-brained)

Scalability
- can't play enough self-play games, work on new ideas soon
- can't afford 1 million games in the window (RAM or disk), work something out

C++
- Eventually modify stockfish - Position, etc. - so it doesn't reach out to uci/options/threads code at all
- Try Intel compiler in future

Python
- Add type info everywhere - look up best practices for linting etc.

Improvements
- Multi-thread MCTS, if not for self-play generation then for UCI play

UCI
- Wrap the C++ with UCI now
	- Need to make TF/etc. silent
	- Work out own threading mechanism or piggyback on Stockfish's if possible
- Implement infinite think, ponder, time controls
- Implement endgame tablebases (invisible/external to the training loop?)
- Switch from python-chess to own board, movegen, etc. (or be sure of GPLv3 static vs. dynamic)

Low priority
- see if it's more efficient saving/loading checkpoints (measure save/load time, prediction time, disk savings)
- 80 cap on branched moves w/ cache may be a problem later; applies before d-noise, so limits exploration
- structured binding, check all pairs

Revisit
- try batch renorm + ghost batch norm
