PUCT - medium confidence
- try prior temperature

Optimization
- finish batched/parallelized ask/tell once training finished
- A/B-test threads/parallelism, and slowstart settings
- A/B-test cache-as-TT with/without repetition state and/or no-progress count (bucketed?)
- long optimization, tournament mode, 30s per move (needs distributed) - include cpuct
- final optimization with just move diversity parameters (consider adding visit%/upweight% threshold) - 30s per move
- deep tournaments, calculate ratings vs. various engines, CC with AZ-PUCT, etc., with various time controls - keep PGNs

Deployment
- need to add alpha version of (tensorflow + tensorflow-text tf-models-official) to instructions once TPU VM fixes are deployed

Measurements
- Tournament Elo across training history (teacher/student, all SWA, every 400k)
- Controlled NPS (fixed movetime, multiple trials) (cache/no, teacher/student, TPU/GPU)
- Self-play games/hour steady-state (from 10 chunks to 20 chunks or w/e) (cache/no, teacher/student, TPU/GPU)
- Training time per checkpoint for main model and commentary (TPU/GPU)
- Test suite results (STS, Arasan21) (teacher/student, TPU/GPU)

Publishing
- write-ups
- final network weights
- datasets? check costs
